<p>Welcome to my webpage, get to know a little about me. Seeing as we won't be able to meet face to face due to classes being online, I hope this website gives some idea about who I am!</p>
<a href=list.html>This is a link to some facts about me</a>   
 <p>Here is a table about some of my hobbies, and how long I have/had been doing each.</p>
 <table>
 <tr>

    <th>Lastname</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
